# Bankruptcy-prevention-prediction

# Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for a project that predicts the likelihood of a company going bankrupt.

# Project Overview
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze financial data of companies and predict their risk of bankruptcy. The goal is to develop a model that can assist financial institutions and investors in making informed decisions.

# Dependencies
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas (data manipulation)
numpy (numerical computations)
scikit-learn (machine learning)
matplotlib (data visualization) (optional)
seaborn (data visualization) (optional)

# Data
The data should ideally include various financial ratios and metrics that can indicate financial health.


# Data Preparation:

The data will need to be preprocessed before training the model. This may involve:

Handling missing values
Feature scaling
Encoding categorical variables

# Models
This project explores different machine learning models for bankruptcy prediction.They are:

Logistic Regression
KNN
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
The code allows for experimentation with different models and hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance.
